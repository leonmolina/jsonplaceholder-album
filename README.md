# JSON Placeholder Project

Project made to put in practice what i've been learning during my React course.
This was a challenging exercise proposed by the B7Web platform and professor Bonieky. I've had issues on how to use the slug for the api request, it really took me hours to figure it out, but after a quick break i've realized where the problem was. Definetely learned a lot while making this, and i'm glad i got it to work!
